# ipfs-wormhole

Get things from one computer to another, safely. Over IPFS (which is not even
required to receive files thanks to IPFS gateways).

Inspired by [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole) and
[dat-cp](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/dat-cp). Initially published
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipfs/comments/9yyqi1/dat_dcpstyle_functionality_for_encrypted_assets/?utm_source=reddit-android).

# Usage

## Send a file or a directory

On machine A:

`ipfs-wormhole.sh send <file or directory>`

Will encrypt and add the file (or the directory as a compressed tarball) to
IPFS, and output a `tag`. This `tag` contains everything the recipient needs to
retrieve, decrypt and save the file. If `xclip` is installed, this `tag` will be
copied to the clipboard.

## Receive a file or a directory (as a compressed tarball)

On machine B:

`ipfs-wormhole.sh receive <tag>`

Will retrieve the file over IPFS if IPFS is installed and running, or if it's
not, over HTTPS thanks to IPFS gateways, decrypt it and save it locally.

## Check dependencies

`ipfs-wormhole.sh checkdeps`

## Update from the github repo

`ipfs-wormhole.sh update`

## Parameters

The default behavior/settings can be modified by environment variables.

### Password length (sender only)

`IWPASSWORDLENGTH=<int>` can be used to set the length of the temporary password
used by the symmetric encryption (default: `40`).

e.g.: `IWPASSWORDLENGTH=50 ipfs-wormhole.sh send FILE` will use a longer
password to encrypt FILE.

Note: Temporary passwords are limited to alphanumeric characters to be easily
added to the `gpg` command line and to the `tag`.

### Asymmetric (key-based) encryption (sender only)

`IWKEYBASEDENCRYPTION=<whateveryouwant>` can be used to replace the default
symmetric encryption by `gpg`'s key-based asymmetric encryption. This removes
the need for a secure side channel to send the `tag`, as the encrypted content
can only be decrypted by the private key of the recipient(s) (a password still
appear in the `tag`, but is useless).

This is the most secure mode but is less easy to use than the symmetric
encryption mode, that's why the latter is the default.

e.g.: `IWKEYBASEDENCRYPTION=whateveryouwant ipfs-wormhole.sh send FILE`, the
usual `gpg` prompt will ask you to choose the public key(s) of the recipient(s).

Note: No specific configuration is required on the client side, as `gpg` is
smart enough to ask for your passphrase if necessary.

### Fallback IPFS gateway (recipient only)

`IWIPFSGATEWAY=<url>` can be used to set the fallback IPFS gateway, if the
recipient's machine does not have `ipfs daemon` running (default: [Cloudflare's
gateway](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com)).

e.g.: `IWIPFSGATEWAY=https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs ipfs-wormhole.sh receive TAG`
will retrieve the encrypted file through the official IPFS gateway if the IPFS
daemon is not running.

# How it works

Your data is encrypted on the sender's machine, using `gpg` and its default
symmetric cipher (which depends on your specific `gpg` configuration), with a
temporary random password generated by `generate_password`. Asymmetric (key-based)
encryption is also supported, see 'Parameters' for details.

Once encrypted, your data is made available to others from your machine using
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io).

The temporary password (as well as the base64 encrypted file name, for that
matter) is concatenated to the IPFS hash in a `tag`, which consequently has to
be transmitted over a secure channel to the recipient's machine (e.g. `ssh`).

On the recipient's machine, the encrypted data is retrieved:

- from IPFS if IPFS is running
- over HTTPS from an IPFS gateway if IPFS it not running (or not installed)

The encrypted data is subsequently decrypted on the recipient's machine with the
password (extracted from the tag), and saved with the proper file name (also
extracted from the tag). When the asymmetric (key-based) encryption is used, the
private key of the recipient will be used to decrypt the file.

Confidentiality is not an issue as long as you trust `gpg` and `/dev/urandom`.

# FAQ

## Who owns my data once I use ipfs-wormhole?

TL;DR No one. `ipfs-wormhole` is end-to-end encrypted with `gpg`. See above for
more details.

## Where does it store my data?

Your data are provided by the sender's machine and routed to the recipient's
machine over [IPFS](https://ipfs.io).
